            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                The Cycle: Frontier is a <span class="tooltip">fps<span class="tooltiptext">(first person shooter)</span></span> developed by Yager Development. Set in a future where space travel is the norm, the game takes place on a dangerous planet called Fortuna III. Players take on the role of prospectors, mercenaries who land on the planet to scavenge for loot, complete quests, and extract valuable resources.
            </p><p>
                The game features a PvPvE (player versus player, player versus environment) gameplay style, where players not only compete against each other but also face the challenges of the hostile environment. The game emphasizes strategy, survival, and resource management, as any equipment not insured is permanently lost upon death.
            </p><p>  
                The Cycle: Frontier offers a variety of game modes, including solo, duo, and trio play, and features crafting, load-out customization, and character appearance options. The game was released in full on June 8, 2022, but its servers were sunset on September 27, 20231.</p>

            <h2>Why is it... dead?</h2>
            <p>The Cycle: Frontier was shut down primarily due to financial viability issues. Despite the developers' best efforts and meaningful improvements, the game struggled to maintain a sustainable player base1. Here are the main reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cheating Issues: Shortly after the game's launch, there was a significant increase in cheating, which affected the overall player experience. Although the developers implemented anti-cheat measures, the damage was already done, leading to a decrease in the player base2.</li>
                <li>Declining Player Numbers: Despite attempts to revive interest with new seasons and updates, the game failed to attract enough players to become financially viable.</li>
                <li>Financial Viability: Ultimately, the game was not generating enough revenue to cover its operational costs, leading to the difficult decision to shut it down.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The developers, Yager, announced the shutdown on September 27, 2023, and offered refunds for recent purchases. They expressed gratitude to the community for their support and mentioned that they would be focusing on new projects2.</p>
            <p>It's always sad to see a game shut down, especially when there's a dedicated fan base. Did you play The Cycle: Frontier, or were you just curious about its story?</p>
